In these settings Simulations 1 (S1) and 2 (S2) were studied by Yoon and Krivobokova(2018). 
Simulation 3 (S3) was built upon the second one but considering different weights schemes for latent factors.
Upn S3 we built Smimulation 4 (S4) assuming a non-linear model between the response and the predictors. 
Simulation 5 (S5) is a modification of S3 in the sense than now Y depends on two non-orthogonal linear combinations. 
With Simulation 6 (S6) we demonstrate that PCA, as an unsupervised method, can miss important information when we consider only few components.
To run the simulations, must have the **Source files** in the environment of R.
