In these settings Simulations 1 and 2 were studied by Yoon and Krivobokova(2018). 
Simulation 3 was built upon the second one assuming a non-linear model between the response and the predictors. 
Simulation 4 is a modification of Simulation 2 in the sense than now Y depends on two linear combinations. 
With Simulation 5 we demonstrate that PCA, as an unsupervised method, can miss important information when we consider only few components.

To run the simulations, must have the Source files in the environment of R.
