This folder include the two real data sets used in this paper:
* the Argentinian National Household Expenditure Survey of 2018 (Encuesta Nacional de Gastos de los Hogares-ENGHO)
* the Argentinian Household Survey (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares-EPH) for the second quarter of 2017
These surveys are carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos from Argentina (INDEC) and we restricted our attention at the household level for the Greater Buenos Aires (GBA) demographic area, where more than 30 percent of the Argentinian population is concentrated.
